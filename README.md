# Requirement-Analysis in Software Development
# Purpose
 the purpose of these repository is all about the requirement analysis in sofware development which focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution. 
 # What is Requirement Analysis?
 Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.
 # Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
 Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering
Engage with stakeholders to collect initial requirements.
Use various techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops.
2. Requirement Elicitation
Refine and elaborate on the gathered requirements.
Use techniques like brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.
3. Requirement Documentation
Document the requirements in a detailed and structured format.
Use requirement specification documents, user stories, and use cases.
4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Analyze and prioritize the requirements.
Create models to visualize and understand the requirements.
5. Requirement Validation
Review and validate the requirements with stakeholders.
Define acceptance criteria and ensure traceability.
# Types of Requirements.
# Functional requirements
This decribes what the system should do
Examples: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.
# Non functional requirements
This describes how the system shouls perform.
Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.
